README for the AUDIO_SPI applications
=====================================

AUDIO_SPI is a set of open source audio applications targeted for the 
Windows Operating System. This application is part of the AUDIO_SPI
software collection.

AUDIO_SPI's applications are based on popular open source libraries
and should therefore be fairly easy to port to various platforms.

AUDIO_SPI  project was started in Montreal in 2010 by Stephane Poirier
with the objective of experimenting with audio to understand the process of
creating music with software applications.

Some AUDIO_SPI applications are used by Carl Poirier who is a Montreal
music composer prototyping an audio operating system called XAOS. The
packaging of the AUDIO_SPI applications sometimes reflects the XAOS
requirements.
